=head1 CONTRIBUTING TO C<Sub::Genius>

Please read the L<README> for latest information, goals, etc..

Feel free to submit issues via GitHub. If there is a feature you think
is missing or something that should covered, contact us before starting
down a rabbit hole.

Otherwise, feedback on this module and approach is most appreciated!

One restriction, I'd like to set in stone in the event this approach
becomes interesting to others is this. The I<power> of restricting the
"serialization" of PREs to the realm of Regular Languages (in the formal
Computer Science sense) is sufficient to do what the module purports.

If any contributor wishes to extend into other types of Languages,
please consider forking this module or creating one's own. Simplicity
in this approach is key to understanding it, and that's not even close
to accomplished.
