=head1 THIS MODULE IS I<EXPERIMENTAL>

Until further noted, this module subject to extreme fluxuations in
interfaces and implied approaches. The hardest part about this will be
managing all the cool and bright ideas stemming from it.

=head1 NAME

Sub::Genius - Manage concurrent C<Perl> semantics in the
uniprocess execution model of C<perl>.

=head2 In Other Words

L<Sub::Genius> generates a correctly ordered, sequential series of
subroutine calls from a declarative I<plan> that may be parallel or
concurrent in nature.  This allows a concurrency plan to be I<serialized>
or I<linearized> properly for execution in a uniprocess (or single CPU)
environment.

Sub::Genius introduces all the joys and pains of multi-threaded, shared
memory programming to the uniprocess environment that is C<perl>.

After all, if we're going to I<fake the funk out of coroutines> [4],
let's do it correctly. C<:)>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # D E F I N E  T H E  P L A N
    my $preplan = q{( A B )  &   ( C D )      (Z)};
    #                 \ /          \ /         |
    #>>>>>>>>>>>     (L1) <shuff>  (L2) <cat>  L3
     
    # C O N V E R T  T H E  P L A N  T O  D F A 
    my $sq = Sub::Genius->new(preplan => $preplan);

    # I N I T  T H E  P L A N
    $sq->init_plan;
     
    # R U N  T H E  P L A N
    $sq->run_once;
    print qq{\n};
    
    # NOTE: sub declaration order has no bearing on anything
     
    sub A { print qq{A}  } #-\
    sub B { print qq{B}  } #--- Language 1
     
    sub C { print qq{C}  } #-\
    sub D { print qq{D}  } #--- Language 2
     
    sub Z { print qq{\n} } #--- Language 3

The following expecity execution of the defined subroutines are all
valid according to the PRE description above:

    # valid execution order 1
      A(); B(); C(); D(); Z();
    
    # valid execution order 2
      A(); C(); B(); D(); Z();
    
    # valid execution order 3
      A(); C(); D(); B(); Z();
    
    # valid execution order 4
      C(); A(); D(); B(); Z();
    
    # valid execution order 5
      C(); D(); A(); B(); Z();

In the example above, using a PRE to describe the relationship among
subroutine names (these are just multicharacter C<symbols>); we are
expressing the following constraints:

=over 4

=item C<sub A>

I<must> run before C<sub B>

=item C<sub C>

I<must> run before C<sub D>

=item C<sub Z>

is I<always> called last

=back


=head2 Meaningful Subroutine Names C<FLAT> allows single character symbols
to be expressed with out any decorations;

    my $preplan = q{ s ( A (a b) C & ( D E F ) ) f };  # define plan
    my $sq = Sub::Genius->new(preplan => $preplan);    # convert plan

The I<concatentation> of single symbols is implied, and spaces between
symbols doesn't even matter. The following is equivalent to the PRE above,

    my $preplan = q{s(A(ab)C&(DEF))f};                 # define plan
    my $sq = Sub::Genius->new(preplan => $preplan);    # convert plan

It's important to note immediately after the above example, that the PRE
may contain C<symbols> that are made up of more than one character.

But this is a mess, so we can use longer subroutine names as symbols and
break it up in a more readable way:

    # define plan
    my $preplan = q{
      start
        (
          sub_A
          (
            sub_a
            sub_b
          )
          sub_C
        &
         (
          sub_D
          sub_E
          sub_F
         )
        )
      fin
    };
     
    # convert plan
    my $sq = Sub::Genius->new(preplan => $preplan);

This is much nicer and starting to look like a more natural expression
of concurrent semantics, and allows the expression of subroutines as
meaningful symbols.

=head2 Inline Comments

A final convenience provided during the preprocessing of PREs (which can
be turned I<off> with C<< preprocess => 0 >> passed to C<new>), is the
support of inline comments and empty lines.

For example,

    # define plan
    my $preplan = q{
      start         # Language 1 (L1) always runs first
        (
          sub_A     # Language 2 (L2) 
          ( 
            sub_a   # L2
            sub_b   # L2
          )
          sub_C     # L2
        &           #<~ shuffle's L2 and L3
         (
          sub_D     # L3
          sub_E     # L3
          sub_F     # L3
         )
        )
      fin           # Language 4 (L4) always runs last
    };
    
    # convert plan
    my $sq = Sub::Genius->new(preplan => $preplan);

=head1 DESCRIPTION 

L<Sub::Genius> generates a correctly ordered, sequential series of
subroutine calls from a declarative I<plan> that may be parallel or
concurrent in nature.  This allows a concurrency plan to be I<serialized>
or I<linearized> properly for execution in a uniprocess (or single CPU)
environment.

It does this by marrying the ability of L<FLAT> to generate a valid string
based on a I<Parallel Regular Expression> with the concept of that string
I<correctly> describing a I<sequentially consistent> ordering of C<Perl>
subroutine calls. This approach allows one to declare a I<concurrent
execution plan> that contains both I<total> ordering and I<partial>
ordering constraints among subroutine calls.

Totally ordered means, I<subroutine B must follow
subroutine A>.

   my $preplan = q{ A   B };

Partially ordered means, I<subroutine A may lead or lag subroutine B, both
must be executed>.

   my $preplan = q{ A & B };

Using this concept, C<Sub::Genius> can generate a valid sequential ordering
of subroutine calls from a declarative I<plan> that may directly express
I<concurrency>.

=head2 C<perl>'s Uniprocess Memory Model and Its Execution Environment

While the language C<Perl> is not necessarily constrained by a uniprocess
execution model, the runtime provided by C<perl> is. This has necessarily
restricted the expressive semantics that can very easily be extended
to C<DWIM> in a concurrent execution model. The problem is that C<perl>
has been organically grown over the years to run as a single process. It
is not immediately obvious to many, even seasoned Perl programmers, why
after all of these years does C<perl> not have I<real> threads or admit
I<real> concurrency and semantics. Accepting the truth of the uniprocess
model makes it clear and brings to it a lot of freedom. This module is
meant to facilitate shared memory, multi-process reasoning to C<perl>'s
fixed uniprocess reality.

The uniprocess model ease of reasoning, particularly in the case of
shared memory programming semantics and consistency thereof. See [3]
for more background on this.

=head2 Atomics and Barriers

When speaking of concurrent semantics in C<Perl>, the topic of atomic
primatives often comes up, because in a truly multi-process execution
environment, they are very important to coordinating the competitive access
of resources such as files and shared memory. Since this execution model
necessarily serializes parallel semantics in a C<sequentially consistent>
way, there is no need for any of these things. Singular lines of execution
need no coordination because there is no competition for any resource
(e.g., a file, memory, network port, etc).


=head2 The Expressive I<Power> of Regular Languages

This module is firmly grounded on the power afforded in expressiveness by
using Regular Language properties to express concurrency. Expansion into
more I<powerful> languages such as I<context sensitive> or I<context free>
is not part of the goal. For anyone interested in this topic, it's a relevant to
consider that since symbols in the PRE are mapped to subroutine names; it
does add computational power when a subroutine is given a C<state> variable,
effectively turning them into I<coroutines>. Memory is power; it doesn't
provide unlimited power, but it is the thing that makes Context Sensitive
Languages more power than Regular Languages, etc.

Given the paragraph above, C<Sub::Genius> may also be described as a way to
explore more or more valid execution orderings which have been derived from
a graph that contains all valid orderings. This graph (the DFA) described
precisely by the PRE.

=head2 Use of Well Known Regular Language Properties

C<Sub::Genius> uses C<FLAT>'s ability to tranform a Regular Expression,
of the Regular Language variety (not a C<Perl> regex!) into a Deterministic
Finite Automata (DFA); once this has been achieved, the DFA is minimized and
depth-first enumeration of the valid "strings" accepted by the original
Regular Expression may be considered I<sequentially consistent>. The
I<parallel> semantics of the Regular Expression are achieved by the
addition of the C<shuffle> of two or more Regular Languages. The result
is also a Regular Language.

From [1],

    A shuffle w of u and v can be loosely defined as a word that is obtained
    by first decomposing u and v into individual pieces, and then combining
    (by concatenation) the pieces to form w, in a way that the order of
    the pieces in each of u and v is preserved.

This means that it preserves the total ordering required by regular
languages I<u> and I<v>, but admits the partial ordering - or shuffling - of
the languages of both. This ultimately means that a valid string resulting
from this combination is necessarily I<sequentially consistent>. Which,
from [2],

    ... the result of any execution is the same as if the operations of
    all the processors were executed in some sequential order, and the
    operations of each individual processor appear in this sequence in
    the order specified by its program.

And it is the C<shuffle> operator that provides the I<concurrent> semantics
to be expressed rather I<naturally>, and in a way the human mind can understand.
This, above all, is absolultely I<critical> for bridging the gap between the
concurrent semantics people clamor for in I<Perl> and the inherent uniprocess
environment presented in the C<perl> C<runtime>.

=head2 Regular Language Operators

The following operator are available via C<FLAT>:

=over 4

=item I<concatentation> - there is no character for this, it is implied when
two symbols are directly next to one another. E.g., C<a b c d>, which can also
be expressed as C<abcd> or even C<[a][b][c][d]>.
    
=item examples,

      my $preplan = q{  a        b        c   };       # single char symbol
      my $preplan = q{symbol1 symbol2 symbol3 };       # multi-char symbol

=item C<|> - I<union> - represented as a pipe, C<|>.

If it looks like an C<or>, that is because it is. E.g., C<a|b|c|d> means
a valid string is, C<'a' or 'b' or 'c' or 'd'>.

=item examples,

      my $preplan = q{  a     |    b    |    c   };    # single char symbol
      my $preplan = q{symbol1 | symbol2 | symbol3};    # multi-car symbol

=item C<&> - I<shuffle> - represented by the ampersand, C<&>.

It is the addition of this operator, which is I<closed> under Regular
Languages, that allows concurrency to be expressed. It is also generates
a I<Parallel Finite Automata>, which is an I<e-NFA> with an additional
special transition, represented by L<lambda>. It's still closed under RLs,
it's just a way to express a constraint on the NFA that preserves the
total and partial ordering among shuffled languages. It is this property
that leads to guaranteeing I<sequential consistency>.

=item B<E.g.>,

      my $preplan = q{   a    &    b    &    c   };    # single char symbol
      my $preplan = q{symbol1 & symbol2 & symbol3};    # multi-car symbol

=item C<*> - I<Kleene Star> - L<Sub::Genius> currently will die if one attempts to use
this, but it is supported just fine by C<FLAT>. It's not supported in this module
because it admits an I<infinite> language. That's not to say it's not useful for
towards the aims of this module; but it's not currently understood by the merely
I<sub-genius> module author(s) how to leverage this operator.

=item B<E.g.>,

      my $preplan = q{    a     &     b*     &   c};  # single char symbol
      my $preplan = q{symbol1 & symbol2* & symbol3};  # multi-car symbol

=item Note: the above PRE is not supported in L<Sub::Genius>, but may be in the future.
One may tell C<Sub::Genius> to not C<die> when an infinite language is detected
by passing the C<infinite> flag in the constructor; but currently the behavior
exhibited by this module is considered I<undefined>:

=item B<E.g.>,

      my $preplan = q{    a     &     b*     &   c      };                    # single char symbol
      my $sq = Sub::Genius->new(preplan => $preplan, 'allow-infinite' => 1);  # without 'allow-infinite'=>1, C<new> will fail here

=back

=head2 Precedence

C<(>, C<)>

Parenthesis are supported as a way to group constituent I<languages>,
provide nexting, and exlicitly express precendence. Many examples in this
document use parenthesis liberally for clarity.

      my $preplan = q{ s ( A (a b) C & ( D E F ) ) f };

For example, the following I<preplan> takes advantage of parentheses
effectively to isolate six (6) distinct Regular Languages (C<init>, L1-4,
C<fin>) and declare their total and partial ordering constraints that
must be obeyed when serialized. The example is also nicely illustrative
of the making a I<plan> more readable using comments (not to suggest an
I<idiom> :)).

    # define plan
    my $preplan = q{
      ##########################################################
      # Plan Summary:                                          #
      #  'init' is called first, then 4 out of 8 subroutines   #
      #   are called based on the union ('|', "or") of each    #
      #   sub Regular Language. 'fin' is always called last    #
      ##########################################################
    
      init # always first
      (
        (alpha   | charlie) &   # L1  - 'alpha'   or 'charlie'
        (whiskey | delta)   &   # L2  - 'whiskey' or 'delta'
        (bravo   | tango)   &   # L3  - 'bravo'   or 'tango'
        (foxtrot | zulu)        # L4  - 'foxtrot' or 'zulu'
        # note: no '&'    ^^^^^ since it's last in the chain
      )
      fin  # always last
    };

          (
            subB_a subB_b
          )
          subC
        &
          subD subE subF
        )
      finish
    };

    my $sq = Sub::Genius->new(preplan => $preplan);

=item C<< cachedir => $dir >>

Sets default cache directory, which by default is C<$(pwd)/_Sub::Genius>.

If set to C<undef>, caching is disabled.

=item C<< preprocess => undef|0 >>

Disables the current preprocessing, which strips comments and adds brackets
to all I<words> in the PRE.

=item C<< q{allow-infinite} => 1 >>

Default is C<undef> (I<off>).

Note: due to the need to explore the advantages of supporting I<infinite>
languages, i.e., PREs that contain a C<Kleene> star; C<init_plan> will
C<die> after it compiles the PRE into a min DFA. It checks this using the
C<FLAT::DFA::is_finite> subroutine, which simply checks for the presence
of cycles. Once this is understood more clearly, this restriction may be
lifted. This module is all about correctness, and only finite languages
are being considered at this time.

The reference, if captured by a scalar, can be wholly reset using the same
parameters as C<new> but calling the C<plan_nein> methods. It's a minor
convenience, but one all the same.

=back

=item C<init_plan>

This takes the PRE provided in the C<new> constructure, and runs through
the conversion process provded by L<FLAT> to an equivalent mininimzed
DFA. It's this DFA that is then used to generate the (currently) finite
set of strings, or I<plans> that are acceptible for the algorithm or
steps being implemented.

    my $preplan = q{
      start
        (
          subA
          (
            subB_a subB_b
          )
          subC
        &
          subD subE subF
        )
      finish
    };
    
    my $sq = Sub::Genius->new(preplan => $preplan);
    
    $sq->init_plan;

=item C<run_once>

Returns C<scope> as affected by the assorted subroutines.

Accepts two parameters, both are optional:

=over 4

=item ns => q{My::Sequentially::Consistent::Methods}

Defaults to C<main::>, allows one to specify a namespace that points to a library
of subroutines that are specially crafted to run in a I<sequentialized> environment.
Usually, this points to some sort of willful obliviousness, but might prove to be
useful nonetheless.

=item scope => {}

Allows one to initiate the execution scoped memory, and may be used to manage
a data flow pipeline. Useful and consistent only in the context of a single
plan execution. If not provided, C<scope> is initialized as an empty anonymous
hash reference:

    my $final_scope = $sq->run_once( scope   => {}, verbose => undef, );

=item verbose => 1|0

Default is falsy, or I<off>. When enabled, outputs arguably useless diagnostic
information.

=back

Runs the execution plan once, returns whatever the last subroutine executed
returns:

    my $preplan = join(q{&},(a..z));
    my $sq  = Sub::Genius->new(preplan => $preplan);
    $preplan   = $sq->init_plan;
    my $final_scope = $sq->run_once;

=item C<next>

L<FLAT> provides some utility methods to pump FAs for valid strings;
effectively, its the enumeration of paths that exist from an initial
state to a final state. There is nothing magical here. The underlying
method used to do this actually creates an interator.

When C<next> is called the first time, an interator is created, and the
first string is returned. There is currently no way to specify which
string (or C<plan>) is returned first, which is why it is important that
the concurrent semantics declared in the PRE are done in such a way that
any valid string presented is considered to be sequentially consistent
with the memory model used in the implementation of the subroutines. Perl
provides the access to these memories by use of their lexical variable
scoping (C<my>, C<local>) and the convenient way it allows one to make a
subroutine maintain persistent memory (i.e., make it a coroutine) using
the C<state> keyword. See more about C<PERL's UNIPROCESS MEMORY MODEL
AND ITS EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT> in the section above of the same name.

An example of iterating over all valid strings in a loop follows:

    while (my $preplan = $sq->next_plan()) {
      print qq{Plan: $preplan\n};
      $sq->run_once;
    }

Note, in the above example, the concept of I<pipelining> is violated
since the loop is running each plan ( with no guaranteed ordering ) in
turn. C<$scope> is only meaningful within each execution context. Dealing
with multiple returned final scopes is not part of this module, but can
be captured during each iteration for future processessing:

    my @all_final_scopes = ();
    while (my $preplan = $sq->next_plan()) {
      print qq{Plan: $preplan\n};
      my $final_scope = $sq->run_once;
      push @all_final_scopes, { $preplan => $final_scope };
    }
    # now do something with all the final scopes collected
    # by @all_final_scopes

At this time C<Sub::Genius> only permits I<finite> languages, therefore
there is always a finite list of accepted strings. The list may be long, but
it's finite.

As an example, the following admits a large number of orderings in a realtively
compact DFA, in fact there are 26! (factorial) such valid orderings:

    my $preplan = join(q{&},(a..z));
    my $final_scope = Sub::Genius->new(preplan => $preplan)->run_once;

Thus, the following will take long time to complete; but it will complete:

    my $ans; # global to all subroutines executed
    while ($my $preplan = $sq->next_plan()) {
      $sq->run_once;
    }
    print qq{ans: $ans\n};

Done right, the output after 26! iterations may very well be:

    ans: 42

A formulation of 26 subroutines operating over shared memory in which all
cooperative execution of all 26! orderings reduces to C<42> is left as an
excercise for the reader.

=item C<run_any>

For convenience, this wraps up the steps of C<plan>, C<init_plan>, C<next>,
and C<run_once>. It presents a simple one line interfaces:

    my $preplan = q{
      start
        (
          subA
          (
            subB_a subB_b
          )
          subC
        &
          subD subE subF
        )
      finish
    };
    
    Sub::Genius->new(preplan => $preplan)->run_any();

=item C<plan_nein>

Using an existing reference instantiation of C<Sub::Genius>, resets
everything about the instance. It's effectively link calling C<new> on the
instance without having to recapture it.

=head1 DEBUGGING AND TOOLS

C<stubby>

This module installs a tool called L<stubby> into your local C<$PATH>. For
the time being it is located in the C<./bin> directory of the distribution
and on Github. It will help anyone interested in getting an idea of what
programming using this model is like.

C<fash>

This tool is I<just> a C<bash> script that makes it easier to called L<FLAT>
powered C<perl> one-liners more efficiently.

Using this tool, one may explore the details of the PRE they are wishing
to use. It allows one to also leverage external tools, such as I<graphviz>,
I<JFLAP>[6], and image programs for seeing the underlying automata structures
implied by the PRE being used. I<Debugging> programs written using the
model provided for by L<Sub::Genius> is certainly going to require some time
debugging. C<fash> is just one way to do it.

This is a shell wrapper around L<FLAT> that provides nice things, like
the ability to dump PFAs generated from a PRE in I<graphviz> format. It
can also dump interesting things like the AST resulting from the parsing
of the PRE (done so by C<RecDescent::Parser>).

B<Note>: with C<fash>, multi character symbols must be encased in square backets.
This is because it calls L<FLAT> routines directly.

Example I<dump> of the I<Parallel Finite Automata> that is described by the PRE
in the C<fash> command below, in GraphViz C<dot> format:

    $ fash pfa2gv "[abc]&[def]" | dot -Tpng > my-pfa.png

Then open up C<my-pfa.png> and see a nice image of your pet Finite Automate
(which may I<surprise> you).

To see all of the useful commands one may use to explore the PRE when
determining how to describe the semantics being expressed when using
L<Sub::Genius>.

=head1 PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS

L<FLAT> is very useful for fairly complex semantics, but the number of
FA states grows extremely large as it moves from the non-deterministic
realm to to the deterministic. 

What that means in most cases, is that the more non-deterministic the PRE
(e.g., the more C<shuffles> or C<&>'s), the longer it will take for the final
DFA to be created. It would not be hard to overwhelm a system's memory
with a PRE like the one suggested above,

    my $preplan = join(q{&},(a..z));

This suggests all 26 letter combinations of all of the lower case letters of
the alphabet (26! such combinations, as noted above) must be accounted for
in the final minimized DFA, which is really just a large graph.

The algorithms inplemented in L<FLAT> to convert from a PRE to a PFA (equivalent
to a PetriNet) to a NFA to a DFA, and finally to a minimized DFA are the basic'
ones discussed in any basic CS text book on automata, e.g., [5].

=head2 Caching

The practicality of converting the PRE to a DFA suitable for generating valid
execution orders is reached relatively quickly as more C<shuffle>s are added.
For this reason, C<init_plan> looks for a cache file. If available, it's loaded
saving potentally long start up times.
