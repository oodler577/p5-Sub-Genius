             - cleaning up POD
             - fixed -TRIAL marker
             - distributing PRE debug too, "fash" from FLAT
             - added ./examples directory, 2 "japh" examples

0.06         2021-04-22 14:30:51-04:06 America/New_York
             - fixed fash POD
             - tweaked distro tarball

0.07         2021-04-25 14:30:51-04:07 America/New_York
             - 'pre' (FLAT term) is now called 'preplan', this makes it
                less implementation dependent
             - added PRE clensing:
             -   auto-bracketizes all 'words', makes it unnecessary to
                 to put space delimited symbols of any length in brackets
             -   accepts and strips comments and empty line

0.08         2021-04-25 14:30:51-05:08 America/New_York
             - cleaned up and reorganized documentation
             - Note: should have been released as a TRIAL

0.09         2021-04-25 14:30:51-05:09 America/New_York
             - added caching (on by default)
             - fixed bug in run_once that unnecessarily
             called ->next; now next() is only called if
             ->plan() is not defined
             - removed mindfa option; if this is desired
               ->dfa can be manipulated directly,
               $sq->dfa($sq->dfa->min_dfa->trim_sinks)
             - added static code gen to stubby
             - cleaned up stubby POD

0.10         2021-04-25 14:30:51-05:10 America/New_York
             - refactored stubby to be more easily extended
               with subcommands; added 'precache' for basically
               compiling PREs into DFAs ahead of their use; caching
               documentation was improved
             - continued refining POD, provided a POC for "lazy linearization",
               which is another potential approach to solving the fast
               growing complexity of converting PREs to DFAs
             - added some more tests
